## FAQ

## Are you more data science, product, or engineering?
I work at the intersection of data science, AI, and product. I’m most effective in roles where I can help shape what gets built, why it matters, and how success is measured — not just implement models or analyses in isolation.

## Are you interested in Product Manager roles?
Yes. I’m interested in product manager roles, especially in data- or AI-driven products where technical understanding, experimentation, and user context matter. I enjoy working closely with engineering and design to turn ambiguous problems into clear plans and shipped features.

## What kinds of roles are you most excited about?
Product-minded data science, applied AI, analytics, and product manager roles where I can contribute to problem discovery, solution design, and iteration — particularly in environments where product, data, and design collaborate closely.

## What types of teams do you work best on?
Collaborative teams that value open ideation, clear communication, and shared ownership. I work best in settings where ideas are discussed early, plans are visible and evolving, and feedback loops are short.

## How do you typically approach a new problem or project?
I start by understanding the problem and the user context, then quickly sketch possible solutions and tradeoffs. I like to get something concrete in front of people early — whether that’s a prototype, analysis, or experiment — and refine based on feedback rather than over-planning upfront.

## How do you think about roadmapping and planning?
I see roadmaps as tools for clarity, not rigid contracts. I prefer lightweight, transparent plans that make priorities and tradeoffs clear, while leaving room to adjust as we learn more from users and data.

## How do you work with engineers and designers?
I enjoy working side-by-side with engineers and designers, especially during early ideation. I like to help translate between technical constraints, user needs, and product goals so the team can move forward with alignment and momentum.

## How do you think about AI and responsibility?
I’m intentional about grounding AI systems in reliable data, being clear about limitations, and designing experiences that encourage trust. I pay close attention to how UX choices affect how people interpret and rely on AI-driven features.

## What distinguishes your approach from more traditional data science roles?
I focus on end-to-end product thinking. That means staying close to users, iterating quickly, and making sure analysis or AI outputs are understandable and actionable — not just technically correct.

## What roles are you looking for?
Product management, product design, and applied AI roles, plus product/analytics roles where I can work close to the product: problem discovery, experimentation, and building usable systems. I’m especially drawn to teams shipping AI features with strong UX and clear metrics.

## What does Hannah do in her free time?

In my free time, I like building and experimenting with small ideas, often using AI tools, to explore product concepts quickly without over-engineering them. I enjoy prototyping interfaces, testing flows, and seeing how far an idea can go with lightweight backends and real data.

Outside of building, I spend time thrifting, traveling, journaling, and staying active. I love surfing when I’m near the ocean and indoor climbing when I’m not. I also spend a lot of time with my rescue dog, Bimo, who has a way of pulling me out of work mode and keeping things balanced. Many of my personal projects come from these interests, especially when curiosity, creativity, and real-world use cases overlap.

## What kinds of side projects does Hannah tend to start?

I tend to start projects that sit at the intersection of data and everyday problems. Usually they come from something I personally want to understand or improve, like making sense of messy information, exploring a bias or pattern, or turning a manual process into something more intuitive.

Most of my side projects start small and practical. I like building just enough to test whether an idea is useful, then iterating based on how it actually feels to use. If something isn’t providing real value, I’m comfortable changing direction or stopping rather than over-polishing it.

## What is Hannah’s professional work experience?

Hannah has worked in data and analytics consulting, partnering with teams to analyze data, design experiments, and translate findings into clear recommendations for stakeholders. Her work focused on applying statistical and analytical methods to real-world business problems, often working across technical and non-technical teams.

In addition to consulting, her experience includes building and shipping product-focused projects end-to-end, combining data science, AI, and user experience design.
