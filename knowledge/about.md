## About Hannah MacDonald

## Professional Title
Product-Minded Data Scientist

## How I Describe My Work
I work at the intersection of applied data science, AI, and product — building systems that turn messy information into tools people actually use. I’m less interested in abstract modeling for its own sake and more interested in how data, experiments, and AI show up in real products, real decisions, and real user behavior.

## Education

### Bachelor of Science in Statistics
- **Institution:** University of Florida  
- **GPA:** 3.7  

## Background & Philosophy
I'm a recent graduate from UC Berkeley's Master's in Data Science program, where I studied applied statistics, machine learning, and data engineering. I'm drawn to the overlap between data, AI, and user experience, especially projects where I can get creative with the problem — whether that's designing experiments, ideating on products and features, or making complex analysis understandable and trustworthy.

What excites me most is building products people actually use, keeping the data story and user metrics front and center. I’m not aiming for pure research roles; I’m most motivated by applied, product-facing work where data and AI directly shape user experience and decision-making.

## Current Focus
I'm most interested in work at the intersection of data, AI, and user experience — building things people actually use by keeping the data story and user metrics front and center.

I like projects where I can be creative with the problem: designing experiments, building models, or turning complex analysis into something people can understand and trust.

## Personal Interests & Approach
In my spare time, I'm constantly experimenting with AI to automate work and prototype ideas quickly. My current stack is Python + SQL + Supabase (Neo4j when graph structure helps), OpenAI APIs for LLM features, and Streamlit or lightweight React frontends.

I use tools like Figma AI, Orchid, and Cursor to move fast from concept to working product, staying grounded in real data and production constraints while keeping things creative. I like work where I can stay technically sharp while still feeling close to the user and the problem being solved.

## Learning Goals
